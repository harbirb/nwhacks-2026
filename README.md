# FIX TRACE

## Issue
I’ve run into this a few times when joining new teams: you hit a setup or debugging issue, later find out someone already solved it months ago, but how they figured it out was not written down. So you ask around on Slack, get unblocked, and then the same thing happens again with the next new joiner.

The problem isn’t a lack of documentation. Developers often don’t have time to write detailed debugging notes. The real work happens in the terminal, and once the issue is fixed, people naturally move on.
