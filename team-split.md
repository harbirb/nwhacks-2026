# Team Split (suggested)

- Person 1: CLI scaffolding, session management, PID handling, `list` command.
- Person 2: Capture engine (`script` lifecycle), signals, file writes.
- Person 3: Parser (ANSI strip, command grouping, JSONL emitter).
- Person 4: Markdown templates, formatting, timestamps, polish.
- All: Testing on zsh/bash, demo prep, README updates.
